# Blackstone-test
React test for Blackstone studio

## Requirements
**Create a React Component that:**
- Is a card component that looks like one of these (https://bit.ly/2Zubi3r).
- Has a slideshow of images that activates when user hovers on the element.
- It should rotate between the images & stop once the mouse is not over and go back to the first image.
- The component will receive props: images (array of images), name (String) & description (String)
- Bonus points: The images are preloaded before the start of the animation & they have nice transitions.
